# Crypto

Basic cryptography algorithms and latex generation.

This library was created to support my latex work in a Cryptography course, but I believe it could benefit other students whose work is Number Theory/Cryptography.

Including latex generation & computation for Successive Squaring, Extended Euclid Algorithm, Chinese Remainder Theorem, Miller Rabin Primality Test.

#### TODO:
- Elliptic Curve over a Finite Field (Elliptic Curve addition algorithm + The Double and Add Algorithm)
- Index Calculus

## Installation and build
[Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html) needs to be installed.
```
git clone https://github.com/attacker0211/crypto.git
cabal repl
```
